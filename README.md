**Artificial Intelligence:** A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including machine learning and deep learning.

**Machine Learning:** A set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a particular task rather than by explicitly programming them.

**Neural Network:** A construct in Machine Learning inspired by the network of neurons (nerve cells) in the biological brain. Neural networks are a fundamental part of deep learning, and will be covered in this course.

**Deep Learning:** A subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks. Often, “machine learning” and “deep learning” are used interchangeably.
